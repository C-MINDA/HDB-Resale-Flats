# Data Visualisation Project

In line with promoting efficiency and data driven processes for the agents, our team have decided to create a functional Tableau solution that would add a significant amount of value to the agents. With this HDB Resale Toolkit they would be able to:
1. Easily access extensive data and consolidated visualisations related to HDB resale trends (Dashboard 1 - Market Analysis).
2. Efficiently filter these visualisations based on the needs and requirements (e.g. HDB type, location, etc.) of their clients (Dashboard 2 - Shortlisting Process).
3. Present key selling points (such as distance to nearby MRT/LRT stations, supermarkets and schools) of suggested resale flats to further tailor their recommendations to their clientsâ€™ needs (Dashboard 2 - Shortlisting Process and Dashboard 4 - Comparison Analysis).
4. Most importantly, provide more suitable and accurate flat recommendations to clients as a result of this data-driven approach (Dashboard 3 - Pricing Analysis and Dashboard 4 - Comparison Analysis).

With the above information, the agents would be able to answer the following questions:
1. What is the current market trend for HDB resale flats?
2. Which flat should I recommend to my client?
3. Should I recommend my client to buy the resale flat now?
